NIPTViewer provides a few different plots and tables that can be used to evaluate the data. QC charts that can be used to
confirm that a run doesn't deviate from previous runs. Results plots used to look for 
alterations in number of chromosomes.

# QC: Historical level
- Fetal Fraction (FF) over time
- NCD (Normalized Chromosome denominator) over time

# Run level
## QC
- Reads per sample
- Fetal fraction
## Results
- Normalized coverage
- NCV X vc NCV Y
- Fetal fraction vs NCV X
- Fetal fraction vs NCV Y
- Fetal fraction vs NCV 13
- Fetal fraction vs NCV 18
- Fetal fraction vs NCV 21
