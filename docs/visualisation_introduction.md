The main purpose of NIPTViewer is to make it easy to visualise data and comparing it against historical data. It allows to view historical data for the following data:

 - QC:
    - Fetal Fraction (FF) over time
    - NCD (Normalized Chromosome denominator) over time
    - NVD over time
 - Result:
    - Chromosome coverage
    - NCV X vc NCV Y
    - NCV X
