NIPTViewer has been develop add Clinical genomics Uppsala.

Clinical Genomics Uppsala is jointly set up by Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital and SciLifeLab with the aim to catalyze the transition of novel research findings into molecular diagnostics for clinical use. The facility is fully integrated within the Uppsala University Hospital and has extensive experience in development and implementation of state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in routine diagnostics. The facility takes on research and development projects with a clear translational profile. With our team of facility associated geneticists, bioinformaticians and medical doctors, we can deliver clinical assessments of the detected variants with the aim to truly provide bench-to-bedside service.
